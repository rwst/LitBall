 - detailed tooltips in dialogs

Doc:
 - can I change keywords during the query process?
 - reasons why not all papers found:
   - start set not representative or not highly cited
   - missing keywords
   - local Chinese papers are underrepresented in S2

Features:
 - "Accept all" button
 - file selectors in settings dialog
 - alternatively use Open Citations
 - recipes: export to / start / import from annotation tool --- both in filter2
 - in filter2()  Prodigy
 - in annotate() export to / start / import from Prodigy
 - optional wordnet capability to include synonyms

Other ideas:
 - somehow use S2 embeddings
 - increase TIMEOUT strategically
 - adding/changing keywords before Finish will change paper list in filter2(), ask yes/no
 - allow || && ! in expressions
