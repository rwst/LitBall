Doc:
 - expr search
 - reasons why not all papers found:
   - start set not representative or not highly cited
   - missing keywords
   - local Chinese papers are underrepresented in S2

Features:
 - file selectors in settings dialog
 - three types of queries:
   1. snowballing with supervision on each round,
   2. snowballing without supervision, needs a stop criterion
   3. simple logical expression matching
 - recipes: export to / start / import from annotation tool --- both in filter2
 - in filter2()  Prodigy
 - in annotate() export to / start / import from Prodigy
 - manually add DOIs to accepted
 - HTTP buffer
 - settings mutex
 - optional wordnet capability to include synonyms
 - clicking sort in filtering2 still grabs focus
 - new query from old (allowing change of keywords but shortcutting some download)

Other ideas:
 - replace 404 msg with "Paper not found"
 - somehow use S2 embeddings
 - increase TIMEOUT strategically
 - adding/changing keywords before Finish will change paper list in filter2(), ask yes/no
 - allow || && ! in expressions
