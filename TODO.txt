 - TAB does not advance field in new query dialog etc
 - add global option to set logging in S2RetrofitHelper, default NONE
 - StringPatternMatcher thinks "()x)" is valid
 - focus: opening/closing filter dialog removes focus on list
 - focus: in filter2 click Save loses focus
 - focus: clicking sort in Annotate still grabs focus
 - focus: changing virtual desktop in Annotate loses focus
 - focus: when in paper detail dialog, cursor up/down still moves list (instead of scrolling details)
 - focus: press A-Z keys to scroll filtered2 and annotated lists in alnum mode
 - filter2: button to scroll to bottommost accepted paper
 - annotate: button to scroll to earliest non-annotated paper
 - 's2:null' in rejected.txt
 - sort annotated by unannotated first (do we really want this, better as additional sorting type?)
 - similarity search finds 20, accepts, doesn't update card:Accepted
 - no-new-accepted set after annotate=0 is not reflected as bold font in query card (touch item)
 - check: no progress indicator when accessing S2 in exportRIS()

Doc:
 - json export
 - recommend getting API key
 - reasons why not all papers found:
   - start set not representative or not highly cited
   - missing keywords
   - keywords too specific (stemness)
   - local Chinese papers are underrepresented in S2
 - Zotero integration == RIS, BibTeX output

Features:
 - night mode
 - DB: use Exposed to handle simple text or JSON files
       alternatively use Exposed with SQLite, see below for both
 - remove all instances of delay()
 - refactor: rename model functions so they reflect the event not the intent
 - file selectors in settings dialog
 - HTTP buffer
 - complain if Q1 date filter in wrong format
 - settings mutex
 - any IO-dispatched code affecting the UI should change state when finished
 - on clicking Annotate: if papers not in archive: either 1. ask to dl or 2. have a frequency for doing auto
 - new query from old: copy more data (archived...), but what if that data is too old?

Other ideas:
 - replace 404 msg with "Paper not found"
 - increase TIMEOUT strategically
 - adding/changing keywords before Finish will change paper list in filter2(), ask yes/no
 - allow || && ! in expressions
 - in PaperList.save() called by annotate() archived.txt gets reduced to only accepted papers. Can we preserve that data?

The abstract typically contains several key sentences that cover different aspects of the research:

 - Background or Introduction Sentence(s): These sentences provide context for the study, including the problem being addressed and its significance. They often include information about the current state of research and why the study was necessary.
 - Objective or Aim Sentence(s): This part of the abstract states the primary goals or hypotheses of the research. It answers what the authors intended to discover or prove with their research.
 - Methods Sentence(s): These sentences briefly describe the methodology used in the study, including the type of research (qualitative, quantitative, experimental, etc.), study design, sample size, and key techniques or instruments employed.
 - Results Sentence(s): Here, the key findings of the study are presented in a concise manner. This may include data, trends, and any statistical significance found. The results are often summarized without detailed statistical analysis, which is reserved for the full paper.
 - Conclusion Sentence(s): The abstract concludes with sentences that summarize the implications of the findings. This includes how the results contribute to the field, potential applications, and suggestions for future research.
 - Limitations Sentence(s) (if applicable): Sometimes, authors include a sentence about the limitations of their study to provide a balanced view and acknowledge any factors that may affect the interpretation of the results.
 - Future Work Sentence(s) (if applicable): This may suggest directions for future research based on the findings of the current study.
 - Statement of Importance Sentence(s): Occasionally, an abstract may include a sentence that directly addresses the importance or impact of the research to highlight its relevance to the field or society.
