 - analyze and make sure DOIs are written uppercase, file-specific modules?
 - mumble benchmark

Doc:
 - reasons why not all papers found:
   - start set not representative or not highly cited
   - missing keywords
   - keywords too specific (stemness)
   - local Chinese papers are underrepresented in S2

Features:
 - search bar in annotate()
 - file selectors in settings dialog
 - recipes: export to / start / import from annotation tool --- both in filter2
 - in filter2()  Prodigy
 - in annotate() export to / start / import from Prodigy
 - HTTP buffer
 - clicking sort in filtering2 still grabs focus
 - new query from old (allowing change of keywords but shortcutting some download)
 - refactor: rename model functions so they reflect the event not the intent
 - settings mutex
 - don't discard non-DOI expr search results / use archived directly?
 - manually add DOIs to accepted

Other ideas:
 - NLP again, Stanford lemmatizer + https://projects.csail.mit.edu/jwi/ + synonyms/hyponyms (or + dmeoli/WS4J) (or via Wikidata)
 - replace 404 msg with "Paper not found"
 - somehow use S2 embeddings
 - increase TIMEOUT strategically
 - adding/changing keywords before Finish will change paper list in filter2(), ask yes/no
 - allow || && ! in expressions
