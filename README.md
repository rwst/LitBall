# LitBall
JVM desktop app for systematic literature collection.

LitBall applies the literature snowballing algorithm[1] on an academic graph (AG) and returns a systematic literature collection on a specific topic. Search runs, starting with a small set of initial papers, are sequences of up- and down-sweeps within the AG, intertwined with filters. These sequences are archived in a local database, as well as all retrieved graph data. Output can be visualized or exported as database for import in any spreadsheet.

LitBall uses [Kotlin/Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/) together with [Conveyor](https://www.hydraulic.software/index.html) to provide binaries for Linux/Windows/Mac.
