# LitBall
JVM desktop app for systematic literature collection.

LitBall applies the literature snowballing algorithm[1] on an academic graph (AG) and facilitates creation of a systematic literature collection on a specific topic. Search runs, starting with a small set of initial papers, are sequences of up- and down-sweeps within the AG, intertwined with filtering using different filters. These processing steps are archived in a local database, as well as all retrieved graph data. Output can be visualized or exported as database for import in any spreadsheet.

LitBall uses [Kotlin/Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/). In alpha versions, users can only try out the application by running it in IntelliJ IDE. Later we plan to use [Conveyor](https://www.hydraulic.software/index.html) to provide binaries for Linux/Windows/Mac.

## Filters
Size and content of the resulting list of papers depends on the filters that are being applied during snowballing. Filters may yield sets of papers that cleanly pass, but may also define a result parameter range for papers that need manual evaluation. In these cases the list of candidates is presented to the user for decision whether to keep or discard a paper. Both automatically and manually discarded papers no longer take part in the following snowballing steps.

While the starter papers, together with required terms, determine the topic(s) of the collection, filters are used to pick specific types of papers. Note that the default filters in LitBall are geared towards laboratory experimental papers because our use case is biocuration. Other filters would be necessary for clinical, pharmacological, or epidemiological papers---when talking biomedical literature. You might even want to apply LitBall in a different field, and there is no reason LitBall could not be applied there, just the filters would need adaptation.

## States of queries

Every query is associated with a directory and the files in it. Since the natural processing step of a query (consisting of 1. expansion, 2. filtering, 3. curation) produces two files, an expanded list of accepted papers, and an expanded list of rejected papers, every state after the last curation---let's call it  CURATED---of any step is indistinguishable. The start state can also be seen as an instance of CURATED, it just lacks rejected papers. In conclusion, there are only three alternating states during the query process: CURATED, EXPANDED and FILTERED. And they can be recognized by looking at the query directory.

A query directory in CURATED state, the next action would be to expand the collection by looking for all references/citations of the accepted papers that are not in the rejected list:
```
XYZ.query
   +---accepted
   +---rejected
```
A query directory in EXPANDED state, the next step would be to apply all completely automatic filters to the expanded list and write the filtered list:
```
XYZ.query
   +---accepted
   +---rejected
   +---expanded
```
A query directory in FILTERED state, the next step would be to present the filtered list to the user for curation, and when finished, add the papers to the accepted and rejected lists, deleting the filtered list:
```
XYZ.query
   +---accepted
   +---rejected
   +---filtered
```
